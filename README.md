### Hi! Welcome to my portfolio!

Here are some recent projects I've worked on:

- [Tableau dashboard about Boston's Bluebikes bike-sharing service](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/andr.garcia1181/viz/BluebikesDashboard/Dashboard1)
- [Visualizing World's Oldest Person data](https://andre-garcia.github.io/worlds-oldest-person/worlds-oldest-person.html)
- [Answering business questions using SQL and R](https://andre-garcia.github.io/answering-business-questions-sql-r/SQL-business-questions.html)

The projects are still works in progress and any feedback is welcome.

Cheers!
